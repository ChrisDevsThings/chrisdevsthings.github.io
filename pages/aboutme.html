          <p class="tagline muted">I’ve been fascinated by computers since childhood - taking apart my mum’s laptop at five just to understand how it worked - and that curiosity has grown into a focused passion for software development. By 13 I was modding Minecraft in Java, and by 15 I had moved on to Python, C, and C++, building projects that pushed my skills further. I’m currently developing a live train-tracking API that I plan to turn into a full web application, and I recently worked with classmates on an IRC server, where I handled backend development and core functionality. I’ve also built my own portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages, to showcase my projects. As a college student studying BTEC Level 3 IT, I’ve strengthened my understanding of computing and software engineering, earning strong grades in units such as Games Development and Programming, and I’m aiming for a D*DD overall. I work primarily in C++ and Java and use Linux -mainly Arch - to deepen my understanding of system internals and command-line workflows. Outside of coding, I’ve been part of Haringey’s Independent Young Advisors since I was 14, developing strong communication, public-speaking, and teamwork skills through volunteering and community involvement.</p>
